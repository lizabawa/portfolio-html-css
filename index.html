                <p>I have been married for five years to my husband Christian, and am a proud dog mom to my labradoodle named Yoda. My hobbies are singing, playing guitar, gaming, and photography.
                    I love to run, although I'm not exactly great at long distances. My goal is to eventually run a marathon (most likely something small, not 5k in the near future)
                </p>
                <p>I am heavily involved with my local church; I sing on the worship team and I take photos. I am an introvert, but I can talk to anybody. I am a mental health advocate.
                    Along with that, I probably have some OCD and ADHD but I've made it this far in life just fine!
                </p>
                <p>I try a little bit of everything. Some hobbies I'd like to try are dancing, pottery, and painting</p>

                <p>My career has been a journey. I feel that I've lived a hundred lifetimes with all the different paths I have tried out, and it has all led me to developing.
                    I graduated in 2016 with a degree in Environmental Health. No idea what that is huh? Basically, I was a health inspector. The only reason I got the degree was because I have never been
                    "book smart", so naturally I gravitated to the easiest degree I could find. I was an inspector for a handful of years and then pivoted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My next role was in a customer service/accounts payable type role remotely. I exceled in the quota/bonus-based environment, and my goal initially was to at some point move up into HR or tech, but those opportunities unfortunately never arose for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually an external role to be a recruiter came up, and I took because that was in the HR world I thought I wanted to pivot into. Unfortunately, burnout got the best of me and I resigned to become a receptionist at an eye doctor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A receptionist is an easy and unchallenging role, and I found that I craved to use the analytical part of my brain. Due to my time as a recruiter, I saw how much developers could make
                    and that the open roles were always remote. I knew I enjoyed remote work from my time in my accounts payable role, and I knew I wanted a job that challenges my critical thinking skills.
                </p>
                <p>That's how I ended up as a developer. For the first time I believe I've found a career I enjoy doing. My career goal now is to land my first developer job!</p>
